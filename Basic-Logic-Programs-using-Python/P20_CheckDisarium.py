# Description: This program determine whether given number is a Disarium Number.
# Summary: A number is said to be the Disarium number when the sum of its digit raised
# to the power of their respective positions becomes equal to the number itself.
# For example, 175 is a Disarium number as follows:
# 1^1+ 7^2 + 5^3 = 1+ 49 + 125 = 175

    n = num

    # Calculates the sum of digits powered with their respective position
    while num > 0:
        rem = num % 10
        s += int(rem ** count_digits)
        num = num // 10

    # Checks whether the sum is equal to the number itself
